    summary: "Whether they’re hiding them in suitcases, stuffing them into socks or (poorly) disguising them as candy, wildlife traffickers have concocted many schemes to smuggle thousands of turtles out of the United States each year. This illegal trade is fueled by a rabid demand for these reptiles, mostly in Asia, where they are used as pets, food or in traditional medicine. In combination with habitat loss and degradation, illegal trade in turtles has led to the imperilment of more than 60 percent of the world’s 356 turtle species — the highest percentage of any class of vertebrate."

Since that time, the use of stocked trout has become a consistent management tool for the N.C. Wildlife Resources Commission. In fact, a little over 18 percent of the approximately 5,400 miles of water in the Commission’s Public Mountain Trout Waters (PMTW) are managed via trout stockings, while the remainder depend on self-sustaining populations to provide fisheries."

The lanky, bald-headed bird, North America’s only breeding stork species, was put on the federal Endangered Species List. State and federal wildlife managers in Georgia and elsewhere then undertook intense conservation efforts to prevent the bird from passing into oblivion. Those efforts paid off. The wood stork was upgraded in 2014 from endangered to threatened, an indication that it no longer faces extinction — another great success story of the Endangered Species Act."

    summary: "We’ve all heard the phrase, “It takes a village to raise a child,” but one Georgia neighborhood found that it actually takes a village to raise a small orchid population.  Called Big Canoe, this neighborhood is located in Pickens County, and is home to the Meadows Committee, a dedicated group of individuals committed to stewarding the Big Canoe Conservation Easement, held by North American Land Trust (NALT).  After a NALT Conservation Biologist discovered the existence of the rare White Fringeless Orchid on this permanently protected Conservation Area, the Meadows Committee learned just how much work and coordination goes into rehabilitating a species.  And thanks to enthusiastic partnerships and the hard work of everyone involved, this orchid was able to grow and flourish into a rare beauty."
