**Atlanta, Georgia** &mdash; The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service proposes to expand hunting and fishing opportunities on another 500,000 acres of national wildlife refuge lands across the South. If approved, the new regulations will take effect this fall.

In all, 22 refuges will offer more than 110 new or expanded hunting and fishing opportunities &mdash; new species to hunt, more acres to hunt and more times to hunt.

“We continue to build upon our recent successes to expand our recreational offerings,” said Leo Miranda, an avid hunter and regional director for the South Atlantic-Gulf & Mississippi Basin. “Hunting and fishing are intrinsically Southern ways of life that also further our conservation work and boost local economies.”

Last month, U.S. Secretary of the Interior David L. Bernhardt announced new and expanded hunting and fishing opportunities across more than 2.3 million acres nationwide &mdash; the single largest expansion in U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service history.

One-fourth of the newly opened lands would be in the South. Last year, the region added 125,000 acres of hunting and fishing opportunities at refuges and hatcheries. Each year, the Service further streamlines regulations to more closely align hunting and fishing regulations with the states.

“The announcement from Secretary Bernhardt was the result of years of collaboration and hard work between the progressive leadership of the Service, state agencies, and the conservation NGO community,” said Chuck Sykes, director of Alabama’s Wildlife & Freshwater Fisheries Division.

The Service, for example, proposes opening an additional 102,455 acres at the Arthur R. Marshall Loxahatchee refuge in south Florida for sport fishing, as well as duck and coot hunting.

At Dahomey refuge in Mississippi, the Service proposes new hunting opportunities for upland game and migratory birds, and a new dove season.

“Now more than ever, we need to be enhancing access to our wonderful natural resources,” said Sykes who's also president of the Southeastern Association of Fish and Wildlife Agencies. “I certainly hope we use these monumental accomplishments to offer more opportunities in the future.”

The Service is seeking comments from the public on the proposed rule. The notice is available at [regulations.gov](https://www.regulations.gov), Docket Number: FWS-HQ-NWRS-2020-0013, and will include details on how to submit comments.

The Department intends to finalize the proposed changes in time for the upcoming 2020-2021 hunting seasons. See the list of refuge and hatchery opportunities in the South in the table below.
