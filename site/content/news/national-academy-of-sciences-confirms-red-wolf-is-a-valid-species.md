The red wolf (C*. rufus*) has generally been accepted as the valid designation for wolves in the southeastern United States. However, for more than 30 years, various studies have reached conflicting conclusions as to the origin, and therefore, the correct taxonomic status of the red wolf. See Red Wolf Origin and Taxonomy section of the [5-Year Review](https://ecos.fws.gov/docs/five_year_review/doc5714.pdf) for more information.

In 2018, Congress directed the Service, via the Department of the Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies Appropriations Act, 2018, to initiate a study, through a qualified independent entity, to determine whether or not animals currently classified as red wolves are a taxonomically valid species. The Service contracted the National Academy of Sciences (NAS) to assess the taxonomic status of the red wolf.

In 2019, NAS released its report, concluding the red wolf is a taxonomically valid species.

Specifically, NAS found:

1. Available evidence suggests that the historic red wolves constituted a taxonomically valid species.
2. Extant red wolves are distinct from extant gray wolves and coyotes.
3. Available evidence is compatible with the hypothesis that extant red wolves trace some of their ancestry from historic red wolves.
4. Although additional genomic evidence from historic specimens could change this assessment, evidence available at present supports species status (Canis rufus) for the extant red wolf.
