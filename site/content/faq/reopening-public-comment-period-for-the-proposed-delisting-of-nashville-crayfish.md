## What action is the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service taking?

[In November 2019](/news/2019/11/nashville-crayfish-proposed-delisting-is-a-hometown-success-story/), the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service), published a proposed rule to remove the Nashville crayfish from the Federal List of Endangered and Threatened Wildlife, and announced a 60-day public comment period on the proposed rule, which ended January 27, 2020.

The Service is now reopening the public comment period on the proposed rule for an additional 30 days, to allow all interested parties additional time to comment on the proposed rule. Comments previously submitted need not be resubmitted and will be fully considered in preparation of the final rule.

## What is the Nashville crayfish?

The Nashville crayfish is a crustacean that grows to about 7 inches long and has four pairs of walking legs and two pincers, called chelae. Crayfish are omnivorous, feeding on a variety of plant and animal material, including algae, insects, worms, fish eggs, snails and mussels.

## Where is it found?

It is known to exist only in the Mill Creek watershed in metropolitan Nashville, Tennessee, in Davidson and Williamson counties.

## When was it listed as endangered under the ESA?

The crayfish was listed in 1986.

## What did the Service consider in reaching its decision to propose this delisting?

This proposed delisting is based on a thorough review of the best available science, including a peer-reviewed Species Status Assessment and a five-year review by the Service. Our review shows there is a low likelihood of threats (human development, increases in impervious cover, impacts to water quality and catastrophic spills) having an impact on the crayfish. In addition, the crayfish has shown greater resilience to these threats than previously thought.

Numerous surveys found the crayfish present throughout the watershed, including in some waters where it had not previously been found. These scientifically rigorous reviews were also used by the Service to make the determination that the threats to the species have been eliminated or reduced to the point that the species has recovered and no longer meets the definition of an endangered or a threatened species under the ESA.

## What actions have the Service and partners taken to help recover this species?

The conservation community has been instrumental in recovery of the Nashville crayfish by protecting Mill Creek and its tributaries. These efforts involved raising awareness about the threats to the crayfish and its habitat, helping restore the stream to a more natural state, and supporting sustainable development in areas near the creek. Groups that played a critical role in recovering the crayfish and its habitat include the Nashville Zoo, Tennessee Wildlife Resources Agency, Mill Creek Watershed Association, private landowners and developers.

## If the crayfish is delisted, will the Service continue monitoring it?

Yes. The Service created a draft post-delisting monitoring plan that will monitor the status of the crayfish and outline any conservation activities for at least five years after it is delisted. It is available at [regulations.gov](https://www.regulations.gov) under Docket No. FWS-R4-ES-2018-0062.

## What are the next steps in the delisting of the Nashville crayfish?

After reviewing and carefully considering all public comments, the Service will publish a final rule. 

## How can the public participate in this process?

We will accept comments received or postmarked on or before October 23, 2020.  The public can post comments at [regulations.gov](https://www.regulations.gov) under Docket No. FWS-R4-ES-2018-0062.
We have scheduled a public informational meeting and public hearing on this proposed rule for Thursday, Oct. 8, 2020, at 6 p.m. CST (meeting) and 7 p.m. CST (hearing). We are holding the public informational meeting and public hearing via the Zoom online video platform and via teleconference so that participants can attend remotely.  We are holding the public meeting and hearing to present information about the November 26, 2019, proposed rule to delist the Nashville crayfish and to provide interested parties an opportunity to ask questions about the proposed rule.

For security purposes, registration is required.  To listen and view the meeting and hearing via Zoom, listen to the meeting and hearing by telephone, or provide oral public comments at the public hearing by Zoom or telephone, you must register.  For information on how to register, or if you encounter problems joining Zoom the day of the meeting, visit the [Tennessee Ecological Services Field Office website](https://www.fws.gov/cookeville).

Registrants will receive the Zoom link and the telephone number for the public informational meeting and public hearing. If applicable, interested members of the public not familiar with the Zoom platform should [view the Zoom video tutorials](https://support.zoom.us/hc/en-us/articles/206618765-Zoom-video-tutorials) prior to the public informational meeting and public hearing.
The public hearing will provide interested parties an opportunity to present verbal testimony (formal, oral comments) regarding the November 26, 2019, proposed rule to delist the Nashville crayfish (84 FR 65098). While the public informational meeting will be an opportunity for dialogue with the Service, the public hearing is not; it is a forum for accepting formal verbal testimony.  In the event there is a large attendance, the time allotted for oral statements may be limited.
