## What is the marron bacora (*Solanum conocarpum*) and where does it occur?

[Marron bacora](/wildlife/plants/marron-bacora) (*Solanum conocarpum*) is a rare, tropical, dry forest shrub native to the U.S. (St. John) and British Virgin Islands (Tortola).

## What action is the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service taking?

[After a review of the best available scientific and commercial information, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service (Service) finds that listing the plant *Solanum conocarpum* as an endangered species is warranted and is therefore proposing to grant protections to the species under the Endangered Species Act (ESA)](/news/2020/08/service-proposes-to-list-rare-virgin-islands-plant-designate-critical-habitat/).  The Service is also proposing to designate approximately 2,550 acres as critical habitat for *Solanum conocarpum* on the island of St. John.

## Why is the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service proposing to list *Solanum conocarpum* as an endangered species?

Originally described in 1813 from a specimen collected in the late 1700s, *Solanum conocarpum* was presumed to have gone extinct until its rediscovery in 1992.  Three of the populations discovered since the species’ rediscovery in 1992 no longer exist.  There are only three remaining populations on the northern side of St. John and four towards the southeast side of the island.  Of these seven existing populations on St. John, all but one occurs within the boundaries of the Virgin Islands National Park.  In 2018, staff from the Royal Botanic Garden (KEW) in Tortola (British Virgin Islands) discovered *Solanum conocarpum* on Tortola, extending the species’ range.

Historic habitat destruction and modification have fragmented the distribution of populations, possibly contributing to a lack of genetic exchange between populations. Another potential threat to all the occurrences of *Solanum conocarpum* is the lack of natural recruitment, most likely due to consumption of its fruits by non-native feral animals such as white-tailed deer, goats, pigs and donkeys.

## What exactly is critical habitat?

Critical habitat is a term defined and used in the ESA.  It is specific geographic areas that contain features essential to the conservation of an endangered or threatened species that may require special management and protection.  Critical habitat may also include areas that are not currently occupied by the species but will be needed for its recovery.

## How does the Service determine what areas to designate as critical habitat?

Within areas occupied by the species, biologists consider physical or biological features needed for life processes.  These include:

* space for individual and population growth and for normal behavior;
* cover or shelter;
* food, water, air, light, minerals, or other nutritional or physiological requirements;
* sites for breeding and rearing offspring; and
* habitats that are protected from disturbances or are representative of the historical geographical and ecological distributions of a species.

Biologists also consider unoccupied areas that are essential for the conservation of the species.

## What is the proposed critical habitat designation for *Solanum conocarpum*?

The Service carefully evaluated the life-history processes of *Solanum conocarpum* and ensured that areas proposed for critical habitat are occupied by the species and contain the physical or biological features needed to support its’ biological needs.  Approximately 2,550 acres (97 percent federal lands; 3 percent private lands) are being proposed as critical habitat for the species on the island of St. John.  This consists of 1,706 acres in the South (1,635 acres = Virgin Islands National Park (VINP); 71 acres = private lands adjacent to VINP) and 844 acres in the North (VINP).
