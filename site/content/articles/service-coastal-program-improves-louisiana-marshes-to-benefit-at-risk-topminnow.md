The saltmarsh topminnow, a rare little fish that grows to about three inches long, is only found along marshes on the northern Gulf of Mexico coast. The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service is researching the species, with the intention of possibly deciding whether it needs to be protected under the [Endangered Species Act](/endangered-species-act/).

In the meantime, the Service is working on the topminnowâ€™s favored habitat in Louisiana. If the habitat can be improved enough, the species may increase on its own without protection.

Service biologist Ronny Paille of the [Lafayette, Louisiana, Ecological Service Office](/lafayette), has been working on two Service Coastal Program projects to construct tidal creeks in marshes on [Sabine National Wildlife Refuge](https://www.fws.gov/refuge/sabine/) where the little fish likes to live. The Army Corps of Engineers created these marshes through their beneficial use of the dredged spoil program.

Construction of these tidal creeks will improve access to many acres of marshes currently not accessible  and will provide over nine acres of tidal creek habitat for the topminnow.

This work has been aided by fish sampling in natural tidal creeks conducted by Paille and Service biologists Kevin Roy, John Savell, and David Oster to document the presence of the topminnow in tidal creeks where no prior records of the topminnow existed.

The biologists were able to determine that the creeks which supported the highest density of topminnows and other marsh resident fishes were 3 to 8 feet wide, 2 feet deep or less (shallower during low tide), and dead-ended in the marsh such that they were not bayous having continuous through-flow.   Using this as a template for the design of artificially constructed tidal creeks, several Section 404 permits have been received for creek construction and several additional projects are also in preliminary stages of development.

Currently, five projects are nearing construction in which over 66,000 linear feet of tidal creeks would be constructed on Sabine National Wildlife Refuge.  In addition to providing habitat for the at-risk topminnow, these creeks would also provide nursery habitat for commercially and recreationally important species such as brown shrimp, white shrimp, blue crab, red drum, spotted seatrout, flounder, and others.   The proposed creeks are proposed in areas where the created marshes are of lower elevation.  Spoil placement and spreading would raise the adjoining marsh surface and provide habitat for rails, seaside sparrow, and other wildlife species which utilize higher elevation marshes.  Spoil placement may also provide additional habitat for the black rail.
